INSTALLATION QUICK START
========================

1. DATABASE SETUP
   - Run the SQL initialization script in database/init.sql
   - Default admin login: admin / admin123

2. CONFIGURATION
   - Edit includes/config.php with your database credentials
   - Update ADMIN_EMAIL if needed

3. EMAIL SETUP

   - Test with the form submission

4. ACCESS POINTS
   - Student Form: http://localhost/media-center/form.php

   - Admin Dashboard: http://localhost/media-center/dashboard.php

5. FIRST STEPS

   - Review settings (form times, approval mode)
   - Test with a student submission
   - Approve/reject passes in dashboard

6. SECURITY
   ============
   
   IMPORTANT SECURITY MEASURES:
   
   a) Change Admin Password Immediately
      - Log in to dashboard with default credentials (admin/admin123)
      - Change password immediately after first login
   
   b) Protected Directories
      - includes/ - Contains config.php with database credentials (BLOCKED via .htaccess)
      - database/ - Contains SQL files and schema (BLOCKED via .htaccess)
      - Both directories return 403 errors if accessed directly
   
   c) File Access Control
      - Only specific PHP files are publicly accessible  (using .htaccess):
        * form.php (student pass request form)
        * login.php (admin login)
        * dashboard.php (admin panel)
        * logout.php (session end)
        * setup.php (initial setup)
        * update_database.php (database migrations)
        * 403.php (error page)
      - All other PHP files (scripts, cron jobs) are blocked from web access
      - .sql, .md, .txt files are blocked from direct access
      - NOTE: in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf, 'AllowOverride All' must be in place for corresponding virtual host, giving .htaccess discretion
   
   d) Production Deployment
      - Set up HTTPS/SSL certificate (required for production)
      - Update config.php to disable error display:
        error_reporting(0);
        ini_set('display_errors', 0);
      - Set strong database password (change from default empty password)
      - Restrict database user permissions (only grant needed permissions)
   
   e) Regular Maintenance
      - Backup database regularly (export via phpMyAdmin)
      - Review admin logs periodically
      - Keep PHP and MySQL updated
      - Monitor failed login attempts
   
   f) .htaccess Files in Place
      - Root .htaccess: Controls access to files and directories
      - includes/.htaccess: Blocks all access to config files
      - database/.htaccess: Blocks all access to SQL files
      - Custom 403 error page displays for unauthorized access

7. SCHEDULED TASKS (Optional)
   - Set up cron jobs for:
     * archive_daily_passes.php (daily at midnight)
     * send_daily_summary.php (daily at specified time)
